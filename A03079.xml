         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For reſpectinge my dutie vnto the right Honourable your Father, my verye good Lorde and Maiſter, and his bountifulneſſe towards mee of his meere beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, without any deſertes on my behalfe: VVhat can bee more due then that the perſon maintained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and preſerued in ſuch commodious and quiet ſtate, as by Gods fauour and prouidence hee enioyeth, though in it ſelfe it bee but poore, meane and ſimple, ſhould beſtow and imploye all his ſtudy, endeuours, and labours, to the vſe, commodity, pleaſure, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation of his maintayner and defender?

Agayne, hauing relation to the matter and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, what is more fit, meere or conuenient, then that a Diſcourſe or Treatice of Chriſtian Chaſtitie, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and written by a Batcheler and ſingleman, by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and profeſsion ſtudious of chaſtitie, ſhould bee dedicated to young vertuous youthes, not only chaſt, but as yet euen Maydes and Virgins? I thought it therfore, no leſſe conuenient vnto my bounden dutie, then meete for your perſons, and profeſsions, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame vnto you. Not for that I am ſo rude or ſenceleſſe that I thinke any of you to ſtand in neede of any ſuch diſcourſe or admonition, whom I know by the great wiſedome and prouidente care of my good Lorde your Father, and by the dilligente inſtruction
<pb facs="tcp:18901:3"/>and nurturinge in the Lorde, of my good Lady your Mother, and by the godly and vertuous domeſticall examples of them both, togeather with your owne good natures, vertuous diſpoſitions &amp; rare toward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to be ſo grounded and ſetled in all godlyneſſe and vertuouſneſſe, as you neede not greatly any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to the ſame, eſpecially ſuch as are deſtitute of Rhethoricall exornations as this is: but as a token of thankefulneſſe, or ſignification of a gratefull minde and humble dutie. Neither yet (peraduenture) ſhall you at any time repent you of the reading hereof, or thinke it a loſſe time, bee it neuer ſo deſtitute of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, trapped wordes or filed ſpeech, as tending ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to playne profite then vayne pleaſure. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the methode and order beeinge ſuch, as the lyke wherof I haue not as yet ſeene in our Engliſh tongue, I hope the pith &amp; ſubſtance of this matter is ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe, as it will delight your vertuous and chaſte eyes, to conſider and vew the ſhew, ſight and proſpect therof, ſeeinge your owne vertues ſo plainly diſplayed, and the daungerous Rockes of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vices wherupon many luſty youthes now a dayes (alas for pittie) do make wofull and vnreparable ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and which you by Gods grace, vertuous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and the prudent and carefull prouidence, and domeſticall example of your honourable Parents, and godly kinſefolkes, haue hitherto (&amp; I truſt euer ſhall, proſperouſly eſcaped) ſo clearely diſcryed. This much I dare be bold to affirme, becauſe I know the Authors wherout I collected the greateſt part of this Treatice, to be godly, vertuous and learned, yea and eloquent alſo, though in this matter for the moſt part ſtudying Breuitie and perſpicuitie they neglect and omit the ſame. But in reading hereof, this I am moſt earneſtly
<pb facs="tcp:18901:4"/>to requeſt: that though in ſome place vice be induced and repreſented in its lothly forme and ſhape, and with termes and Phraſes vnfit for VVorſhipfull eares, yet that you would of your goodneſſe, beare with the ſame, ſeeinge it was firſt written for Children, mine owne neare &amp; deare kinſewomen, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I thought it was expedient, that vice and the filthy practices of the vitious, ſhould be ſet out in their blacke, and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours, to the intente that youth might euen from the very hart ſhun, hate, abhor, and deteſt the ſame, as of all the godly and vertuous it is, and ought to bee. And that which the Axe of courteous interpretation, and of taking and conſtruinge of thinges in the better part, which is an excellent vertue, eſpecially beſeming all Gentlefolkes, in Latine commonly called <hi>(Candor)</hi> a proper name in Engliſh, for the which vertue (ſuch is the barenneſſe of the tongue in ſome parts) we lack, you would at once ſhred away, &amp; cut of all ſuſpitions, and not once to thinke or ſuſpect that I wrote and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this diſcourſe or treatice of Chriſtian Chaſtitie, for that I ſawe any more inclination to the contrary vices in my ſayde deare Coſins, then is in the beſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſince the generall corruption of the ſame, in the roote of the two firſt created, the origin of al humaine nature: For certainly, to ſpeake as we vſe to ſpeake of the beſte natures: they are all of a rare towardneſſe in that ſexe, verye godly and vertuouſly brought vp, but yet ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And therfore for the naturall loue I bare vnto them, beeing my neare kinſewomen (for it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall property of true loue, for to forewarne the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beloued of all ſuch perilles as it foreſeeth may fall vpon them without diligent caution or circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) I wrote this treatice to enarme them againſt that
<pb facs="tcp:18901:4"/>time of their age, which the very Paganes by the only light of nature ſaw to be moſt daungerous and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, as may plainely appeare to all ſuch as haue reade or ſenſibly heard the ſtory (or Poeticall Narration) euen of <hi>Hercules</hi> the Sonne of their great God <hi>Iupiter</hi> (as they propound it) in his budding yeares ſitting in the VVilderneſſe in a maze whither way to take, that of vice, or that of vertue. And therfore, ſeeing this happened in the heroicall nature of <hi>Hercules,</hi> commen (as is affirmed) of progenie diuine, I thought it not ſuperfluous to admoniſh my kinſewomen, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo good a nature and inclination, to decline the way of vice, and to take the prooued Path of Vertue, trodden out vnto them by their godly Parentes.

For I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of mine owne pouertie, weakeneſſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilitie in matters of wit and learninge. But as I haue due proofe and experiment hereof, ſo do I know that the giftes of God are diuerſe, and ſeuerally beſtowed according to his good pleaſure, without beeing tyed to perſon, place, time, or other circumſtaunce.

And had found and perceaued through Gods grace both mine owne minde and theirs, not a litle to be confirmed in the purpoſed race of chaſte and vnſtayned life (moſt fit for ſingle perſons) by the collecting, writing, and often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of the ſame: I thought it contrary to the rule of Chriſtian Charitie to hide or with holde that from my chriſtian brethren, that I was perſwaded might do them good, without any (I hope) my great loſſe or hinderance. And though I am not ignorant how dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous a matter it is for the vnpractiſed, in this lerned age furniſhed with ſuch ſage and graue heads, with ſo many fine wittes, and with youth of ſuch rare towardneſſe, and wonderfull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, and ſo beautified, and adorned with all kinde of Science ſo exactly knowen, to commit any thinge vnto the open view of the eyes of the worlde: Yet ſeeinge this is written for the vnlearned onely (whom I truſt it will profite) and not for the learned who neede no inſtruction, I feared not to preferre common vtilitie, before prinate daunger.

Finally, whereas it is truely affirmed and euen in the beſt learned verified: Humanum eſſe errare, <hi>That, it is a thing incident to man to erre,</hi> and therfore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee, but the vnlearned (amonge whom I ſupply a roome) muſt now and then miſſe the quiſhin: I craue thy gentle patience and fauourable correction therin.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18901:40"/>commaundement, is as you haue hearde, that wee ſhould poſſeſſe our bodies in honour and holines, not in luſt and concupiſcence, as they doo that know not GOD. <hi>1.

                  <p>Here I might goe throughout all the ten Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, in like ſorte as I haue doone afore, almoſt throughout the Lordes Prayer, and confeſſion of our faith, and ſo prooue that whoores and whooremongers keepe none of them all. For example wherof, let vs take the firſt commaundement: If they did loue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. all thinges, as that commaundemente requireth, they would not diſobey him, for a litle filthy and beaſtly pleaſure. And to touch them all for admonition ſake to the ignorant: If they did keepe the ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they would ſerue the Lorde in ſpirite and truth, as therby is required, and not the fleſh in luſt and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the third: they would not take the name of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt, in vaine: For in vaine is it to be called a chriſtian, the member of Chriſt, but to bee in déede, the member of an whoore or harlot. If the fourth: they would expreſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in their life and conuerſation, the ſpirituall reſte there commaunded, that is, to reſt from their owne will, to do Gods will, which is our holyueſſe and abſtinence from all vncleaneneſſe, as before is ofte declared. If the fifth: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they would honour the bodyes of their Neighboures, and euen chriſten, and not diſhonour and prophane them with ſuch filthineſſe, and abbomination, and they would honour God, the father of Fathers, or chiefe Father, of whom all paternitie or fatherlineſſe is named, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, by due reuerence and obedience to his ſayde commaundemente of holyneſſe, and continencie from all impuritie, ſo ofte in ſacred Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and vrged. If the ſixte: they woulde not ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> cruellye ſlaye the ſoule as they doo: For to ſeperate the ſoule from GOD, the lyfe thereof (which is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18901:41"/>doone by whoredome and ſuch like beaſtlineſſe) is to kill and deſtroy the ſame, &amp; ſo to commit ſpirituall murther. If the ſcuenth: they would liue temperately, modeſtly; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſoberly, chaſtely, and honeſtly, as therby is commaunded. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If the eyghth, they would not ſteale away their owne good names and fames, which is more precious then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly ſubſtaunce: nor their bodies and ſoules from Chriſt, the right owner of both, for hée bought them full drare, euen with his owne harte blood. If the nynth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they would not beare falſe witneſſe, to the whole Church and congregation of Chriſt: proteſting themſelues to be the members of Chriſte, wheras, in very déede, they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> nothing leſſe. And as for the tenth, it is directly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, againſt luſt and concupiſcence, wherin whoores and whooremongers walke.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges might bée ampliſied, and drawen out at large, with horror and deteſtation. But my leaſure (as I ſaide) will not ſuffer mee to proſequute all. Thus much (for aſſay) may ſuffice, for godly, diligent, and vertu ous mindes.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee that whoores and whooremongers, doo neither beleeue, nor pray aright, nor kepe any of gods commaundementes, and ſo conſequently, that chriſtian Religion and whooredome, can not bee in one perſon, at one time and inſtant. And therfore, as longe as we are poſſeſſed with the filthie ſpirite of Fornication, wee are for the time as Infidels, and ſtraungers from God, and without a God, which how miſerable a thing it is, I pray God open the eyes of our mindes, that wee may ſee, and déepely conſider.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges I thought good, bréefely to note, to the intente that I might giue an occaſion to you, and to all that are Godly diſpoſed to thinke on, and to conſider the peculier, proper, and ſpeciall naughtines and hurtfulnes of this beaſtly ſinne, which other ſinnes haue not, to the intent, that as it is ſingularly burtful, ſo it may be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and auoyded with a ſingular hatred, and deteſtation.
